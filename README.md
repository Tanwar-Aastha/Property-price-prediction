## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of properties based on their features. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the model provides insights and predictions that can be utilized for real estate decision-making. The project also includes a user-friendly app for users to input property details and get predictions.

## Dataset

The data is scraped using Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. After scraping, the data is cleaned, processed. 

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:
- Location: Geographic location of the property
- Size: Size of the property in square feet or meters
- Number of Rooms: The number of rooms in the property
- Age of Property: How old the property is
- Other Features: Additional features such as amenities, nearby schools, transportation, etc.
